## 🌥️ About Word Clouds

A word cloud is a simple visualization that shows the most frequent words in a text. Larger, darker words appear more often in the text, while smaller, lighter ones are less common. Word clouds don’t replace deep analysis, but they are a gentle entry point into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). They give you an instant “feel” for the text — its mood, repeated ideas, and rhythm — before you move on to structured methods like keyword extraction, co-occurrence networks, or topic modeling.

## 🌱 My Learning Note

- This project is part of my **learning-NLP journey**. While exploring the pipeline — Problem Definition → Data Collection → Preprocessing → Exploratory Data Analysis → Feature Engineering → Model Building → Evaluation → Deployment — I became fascinated by the role of **word clouds** in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- A word cloud doesn’t always need to conclude something. Sometimes it’s like standing on a beach and watching the sea — you don’t demand a message from every wave; you just let the rhythm wash over you. 🌊
- In the **Tamil word clouds**, I could do only limited preprocessing, so all the words from the text simply appear together as a cloud. For **The Little Prince**, I excluded stopwords and filtered mainly for nouns and verbs.
- Please check the `happy-prince` folder to follow my progress as I continue learning.  

*Thank you for sharing this little learning-journey with me.* 🌿
